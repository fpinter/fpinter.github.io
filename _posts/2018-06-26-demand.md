For those in search of economics references, I prepared some [notes on demand estimation in industrial organization]{{"/notes/Demand_Estimation_Notes.pdf" | absolute_url }}. They survey a selected sample of discrete choice models, from multinomial logit to modern Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes--type methods.

While originally written as a study guide for a graduate-level industrial organization class, they can also serve as a high-level introduction for anyone who wants to use demand estimation.

The notes discuss conceptual and technical points, such as:

1. Differences between product-space and characteristics-space models
2. Interpreting the multinomial logit model
3. Bridging traditional demand estimation and industrial organization methods, with unobserved quality
4. Understanding the random-coefficients demand model behind BLP, and the MPEC and nested fixed-point estimators
5. Extensions to standard methods, including adding micro data (Micro BLP) and incorporating a supply-side model
6. Econometrics of the BLP estimator
7. Remaining difficulties, and some applications (including merger simulation)

Please contact me if you have any comments or suggestions -- or just to let me know if you've found this summary useful.
