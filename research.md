**Job Market Paper**: "[Regulatory Mandates and Electric Vehicle Product Variety](https://www.frankpinter.com/Pinter_JMP.pdf)" (with [Sarah Armitage](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sarmitage))

*Abstract*: When should policies to encourage new types of products use supply-side tools, like regulations and mandates, and when should they use demand-pull tools like consumer incentives? When prices are set nationally but policy varies regionally, supply-side and demand-pull tools are no longer equivalent. We study an important regional supply-side policy in the early electric vehicle industry: the zero-emission vehicle mandate in California and nine other states. Focusing on the 2009--17 period, we examine two channels for policy effects: imperfect competition and endogenous product entry. Using a structural model of new vehicle pricing, demand, and product entry, we compare the mandate to a counterfactual demand-pull policy that instead uses a consumer subsidy and tax. Holding fixed the regulator's stated target, electric vehicle sales in regulated states, the demand-pull policy creates a weaker incentive for socially beneficial product entry and generates lower consumer and total surplus. When fewer products are introduced, producers avoid entry costs, but forego long-run benefits of entry.
