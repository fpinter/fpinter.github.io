**Job Market Paper**: "[Regulatory Mandates and Electric Vehicle Product Variety](https://www.frankpinter.com/Pinter_JMP.pdf)" (with [Sarah Armitage](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sarmitage))

*Abstract*: When should policies to encourage new types of products use supply-side tools, like regulations and mandates, and when should they use demand-pull tools like consumer incentives? We study an important supply-side policy in the early electric vehicle industry: the zero-emission vehicle mandate in California and nine other states. Focusing on the 2009--17 period, we examine the interaction between imperfect competition and endogenous product entry. After showing that firms internalized much of the social benefit of entry under the mandate, we evaluate a counterfactual policy that replaces the mandate with a demand-pull subsidy and tax regime. Holding fixed the regulator's stated target, electric vehicle sales in regulated states, the demand-pull policy creates a weaker incentive for socially beneficial product entry and generates lower consumer and producer surplus. When fewer products are introduced, producers avoid entry costs, but forego long run benefits of entry.
