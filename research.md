**Job Market Paper**: "[Regulatory Mandates and Electric Vehicle Product Variety](https://www.frankpinter.com/Pinter_JMP.pdf)" (with [Sarah Armitage](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sarmitage))

*Abstract*: When should policies to encourage new types of products operate on the supply side of the market, using regulations and mandates, and when should they operate on the demand side, using consumer incentives? We study an important supply-side policy in the early electric vehicle industry: the zero-emission vehicle mandate in California and nine other states. Focusing on the 2009--17 period, we examine the interaction between two channels that may cause supply-side and demand-side policies to differ: imperfect competition and endogenous product entry. After showing that firms internalized much of the social benefit of entry under the mandate, we evaluate a counterfactual policy that replaces the mandate with a demand-side subsidy and tax regime. Holding fixed the regulator's stated target, electric vehicle sales in regulated states, the demand-side policy generates a wider gap between private entry incentives and social welfare, suggesting that product variety would be lower. Consumer and producer surplus are both lower under the demand-side policy. When fewer products are introduced, producers avoid entry costs, but forego long run benefits of entry.
