I am a PhD candidate in Business Economics at Harvard University, specializing in industrial organization. My [research](/research) studies the effects of environmental policy in imperfectly competitive markets. Starting in summer 2022, I will be an antitrust economist at the Federal Trade Commission.

Before graduate school I worked at [The Brattle Group](http://www.brattle.com), an economic consulting firm. There, I worked with discrete choice demand models on [a class action antitrust case](http://www.brattle.com/news-and-knowledge/news/daubert-motion-granted-based-on-testimony-of-brattle-principal-daniel-mcfadden), used [machine learning tools for text analysis](https://doi.org/10.1515/ev-2016-0007) to explore large collections of documents, and ran lots of regressions. Before that I studied economics and mathematics at the University of Chicago, with digressions into programming and applied machine learning.
