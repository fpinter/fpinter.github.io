I am an economist specializing in industrial organization. My [research](/research) studies the effects of environmental policy in imperfectly competitive markets. Since summer 2022, I have been an antitrust economist in the [Bureau of Economics](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-economics) at the US Federal Trade Commission.

I earned my PhD in [Business Economics](https://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/phd-programs/business-economics/) from Harvard University in May 2022. My dissertation, on empirical industrial organization and environmental policy, was advised by Ariel Pakes, Robin Lee, and Dennis Yao.

Before graduate school I worked at [The Brattle Group](http://www.brattle.com), an economic consulting firm, where I worked with discrete choice demand modeling on [a class action antitrust case](http://www.brattle.com/news-and-knowledge/news/daubert-motion-granted-based-on-testimony-of-brattle-principal-daniel-mcfadden), used [machine learning tools for text analysis](https://doi.org/10.1515/ev-2016-0007) on large collections of documents, and ran lots of regressions. Before that I studied economics and mathematics at the University of Chicago, with digressions into programming and applied machine learning.
