I am a PhD student in Business Economics at Harvard University, specializing in industrial organization. My research studies the operation of government policy in oligopolistic industries, focusing particularly on environmental policy.

From 2014 to 2016 I was a research analyst at [The Brattle Group](http://www.brattle.com), an economic consulting firm. There, I worked with structural models on cases like [this one](http://www.brattle.com/news-and-knowledge/news/daubert-motion-granted-based-on-testimony-of-brattle-principal-daniel-mcfadden), used exploratory text analysis for projects like [this one](https://doi.org/10.1515/ev-2016-0007), and ran lots of regressions. Prior to that I studied economics and mathematics at the University of Chicago, with digressions into programming and applied machine learning.
