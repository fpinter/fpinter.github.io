I am an economist with [research](/research) in industrial organization, environmental policy, and related fields. I work as an antitrust economist in the [Bureau of Economics](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-economics) at the US Federal Trade Commission.

I earned my PhD in [Business Economics](https://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/phd-programs/business-economics/) from Harvard University in 2022. My dissertation was advised by Ariel Pakes, Robin Lee, and Dennis Yao. At Harvard, I served as Teaching Fellow for the graduate-level core econometrics course.

Before graduate school, I worked at [The Brattle Group](http://www.brattle.com), an economic consulting firm. Before that, I studied economics and mathematics (with digressions into programming and applied machine learning) at the University of Chicago.
