I am a PhD candidate in Business Economics at Harvard University, specializing in industrial organization. I am on the job market in 2021--22. My research studies the operation of government policy, particularly environmental policy, in markets for differentiated products. My job market paper studies the effects of a supply-side environmental policy on the electric vehicle market, focusing on the interaction between imperfect competition and product entry decisions.

My other activities in graduate school have included being a teaching assistant for the first-year graduate econometrics course, teaching programming and statistics in the economics department's math camp for incoming graduate students, and working as a research assistant on a health economics project. I am also a Pre-Doctoral Fellow in the Harvard Environmental Economics Program.

From 2014 to 2016 I was a research analyst in the San Francisco office of [The Brattle Group](http://www.brattle.com), an economic consulting firm. There, I worked with discrete choice demand models on [a class action antitrust case](http://www.brattle.com/news-and-knowledge/news/daubert-motion-granted-based-on-testimony-of-brattle-principal-daniel-mcfadden), used [machine learning tools for text analysis](https://doi.org/10.1515/ev-2016-0007) to explore large collections of documents, and ran lots of regressions. From 2010 to 2014 I studied economics and mathematics at the University of Chicago, with digressions into programming and applied machine learning.
